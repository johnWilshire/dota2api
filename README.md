# A Dota 2 Api Wrapper in R

This is an R wrapper for the Dota 2 api.

To use it you need an [apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

See: https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI#Dota_2 for more details

It makes some tasks easier such as:
* getting all match_ids associated with a user

# Examples

# Installation
Its not really ready yet but if you want to try it you can install it using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

```r
devtools::install_github("johnWilshire/dota2api")
```

If you don't have devtools installed you will see an error "there is no package called 'devtools'"; if that happens install devtools with `install.packages("devtools")`.
